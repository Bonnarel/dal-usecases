# DAL Usecases Repository

A collection of usecases for Data Access Layer standards.

## Context

- The usecases detailed in this repository support the DAL standards but are not part of the standards. 
  They are a resource to assist discussion of features both while they are being proposed/developed and later, to provide context for the features.
  
- This repository is modelled on the Data Models woring group use cases repository, https://github.com/ivoa/dm-usecases

## Repository setup

- All use cases are located in `use-cases`
- Each use case has the following content
    - One `README` describing the case
    - One sub-directory for each proposal
        - The content of the proposal sub-dirs is left to the discrepancy of the author.
        - It must however contain data and text (`README`) only.
